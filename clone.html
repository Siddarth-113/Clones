    <p>The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: Автомат Калашникова, lit. 'Kalashnikov's automatic [rifle]'; also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK), is an assault rifle that is chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalashnikov" target="_blank">Mikhail_Kalashnikov</a>, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov (or "AK") family of rifles. After more than seven decades since its creation, the AK-47 model and its variants remain one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. It was presented for official military trials in 1947, and, in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service for selected units of the Soviet Army. In early 1949, the AK was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces[10] and used by the majority of the member states of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact" target="_blank">Warsaw_Pact</a>.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>During World War II, the Sturmgewehr 44 rifle used by German forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts.[11][12] The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, the 7.92×33mm Kurz, and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.[13][14] On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR.[15] The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own,[11][12] to replace the PPSh-41 submachine guns and outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army.</p>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Mikhail Kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in 1941 while recuperating from a shoulder wound that he received during the Battle of Bryansk.[20][21] Kalashnikov himself stated..."I was in the hospital, and a soldier in the bed beside me asked: 'Why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men when the Germans have automatics?' So I designed one. I was a soldier, and I created a machine gun for a soldier. It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova, the automatic weapon of Kalashnikov—AK—and it carried the year of its first manufacture, 1947."</p>
